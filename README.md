# Even Number Calculator in Java
 Defines a new object called Even that consists of even integers, with associated methods to do basic mathematical operations on them.
 Contains a driver class that makes this a functional command line calculator.
 The EvenDriver.java file is the driver, and uses regex matching to make sure that the user inputs a properly formatted operation.
 The Even.java file defines the object of type even, and uses BigIntegers to avoid buffer overflow when doing the calculations.
